# Step-by-Step Tutorial: Setting Up a Kobra 3 Max in Your Garden Shed

This guide explains how to install your Kobra 3 Max in the vidaXL Gerätehaus (88 × 89 × 161 cm, galvanized steel) garden shed. It covers insulating the shed with foam panels, creating an exhaust vent with a proper fan and digital temperature controller, and safely running power via flat solar cables.

## **1. Planning & Materials**

### **Shed & Printer Overview**

- **Shed:** vidaXL Gerätehaus, 88 × 89 × 161 cm.
- **Printer:** Anycubic Kobra 3 Max Combo  
  - Print volume: ~400 × 400 × 450 mm.
  - Operating environment: Internal temperatures can reach 40–50°C.

### **Materials Checklist**

- **Insulation:**
  - **XPS (Extruded Polystyrene) panels, 2–3 cm thick, with a reflective foil coating.**  
    *Recommendation:* XPS is preferred over EPS due to its higher compressive strength and moisture resistance—ideal when interior temperatures run 40–50°C.
- **Ventilation Components:**
  - **Exhaust Fan:**  
    - **Primary Recommendation:** 80 mm fan (e.g., Noctua NF-A8 PWM) in a weatherproof housing.  
    - **Notes on Fan Size:**  
      - **80 mm vs. 120 mm:**  
        - **80 mm Fans:** Are compact, easier to mount on small openings, and typically provide a good balance of airflow and noise.  
        - **120 mm Fans:** Provide higher airflow but require a larger cut-out and can be bulkier in a small shed.  
      - **Multiple 80 mm Fans:** If the shed requires greater ventilation, you could install two or more 80 mm fans. They offer the advantage of more flexible placement and redundancy in case one fails.
  - **Digital Temperature Controller:**  
    - **Recommended Model:** Inkbird ITC-308 (or a similar dual-output model) to control both the exhaust fan and, optionally, a heater or heat lamp.
- **Power Routing:**  
  - **Flat Solar Cable:** Rated for 1500V (suitable for 240V AC use), thin enough (3–5 mm) for a window/door pass-through.
  - **Pass-through Accessories:** Weatherproof grommets or flat feed-through connectors.
- **Tools & Supplies:**  
  - Measuring tape, utility knife, metal cutting tool (reciprocating saw with metal blade), drill with hole saw, construction adhesive, double-sided foam tape, reflective foil tape, cable ties, and safety gear (gloves, goggles).

## **2. Preparing & Insulating the Shed**

### **A. Installing the Insulation**

1. **Measure & Cut Panels:**  
   - Measure interior walls and ceiling.  
   - Cut XPS foam panels (2–3 cm thick) to fit each surface precisely.

2. **Mount the Panels:**  
   - Use construction adhesive or heavy-duty double-sided tape to attach the panels to the interior walls and ceiling.
   - Position panels so the reflective side faces the interior to help reflect radiant heat back, maintaining a more stable temperature.

3. **Seal the Seams:**  
   - Use reflective/aluminum foil tape along panel seams and edges.  
   - Apply additional foam tape around doors and any windows to minimize drafts and moisture ingress.

### **B. Creating an Exhaust Vent**

1. **Plan the Fan Location:**  
   - Choose an upper wall or near the ceiling where hot air gathers.

2. **Cutting a Hole:**  
   - Mark an 85–90 mm diameter circle on the exterior metal wall (suitable for an 80 mm fan).
   - Drill a pilot hole with a hole saw and finish cutting with a reciprocating saw. Wear safety gear during cutting.
   
3. **Install a Sealing Adapter:**  
   - Fit a weatherproof rubber grommet or insulated flanged adapter into the hole.  
   - This helps seal the opening against rain and minimizes heat loss.

## **3. Ventilation & Temperature Control Setup**

### **A. Installing the Exhaust Fan**

- **Fan Selection & Size:**  
  - **Primary Choice:** An 80 mm fan like the Noctua NF-A8 PWM is recommended for its quiet operation and efficient airflow.  
  - **Why 80 mm?:**  
    - Fits smaller cut-outs (ideal for the 88 cm wide shed).  
    - Easier to mount in a compact space compared to a 120 mm fan.  
    - If increased airflow is needed, consider installing two 80 mm fans in parallel rather than one bulky 120 mm fan.
  
- **Wiring & Powering the Fan:**  
  - **Important Note:** These fans operate on DC voltage (usually 12V or 5V), not directly on AC power.
  - **Powering the Fan:**  
    - Use a small 12V DC adapter or power it via the digital temperature controller’s output.  
    - The Inkbird ITC-308, for example, can switch 12V DC loads to run your fan.
  - **Mounting:**  
    - Secure the fan over the cut-out using appropriate brackets, ensuring that its orientation pulls warm air out of the shed.
  
### **B. Setting Up the Digital Temperature Controller**

- **Recommended Controller:**  
  - **Inkbird ITC-308** (or similar) is low-cost and reliable.
  
- **Installation:**  
  - Mount the controller in a central location inside the shed.
  - Connect the exhaust fan to one relay output.
  - **Optional Heating:** Connect a low-wattage ceramic heater or heat lamp to the second relay if ambient temperatures drop below your desired threshold.
  
- **Programming the Controller:**  
  - Set the fan to activate when temperatures exceed ~40°C.
  - If using a heater, set it to come on when temperatures drop below ~15°C.

## **4. Running Power with Flat Solar Cables**

### **A. Cable Preparation & Installation**

1. **Select the Flat Solar Cable:**  
   - Ensure it’s rated for 1500V (safe for 240V AC) and thin (around 3–5 mm) for easy pass-through.

2. **Connector Adaptation:**  
   - If needed, remove the existing connectors and attach AC-rated connectors (e.g., Anderson connectors paired with an adapter to a Schuko plug).
  
3. **Installing the Pass-Through:**  
   - Choose a window or door with a small gap.  
   - Install a dedicated pass-through using a flat feed-through connector or by carefully cutting a small opening.
   - Seal the cable passage with a weatherproof rubber grommet and tape to prevent moisture entry.

### **B. Wiring the Power**

- **External End:**  
  - Connect to your AC power source.
  
- **Internal End:**  
  - Use an AC-to-DC adapter (if needed) or a power strip to supply power to your printer and other electronics.
  
- **Safety:**  
  - Always verify wiring with a voltage tester before powering up your devices.

## **5. Installing the Kobra 3 Max Printer**

1. **Platform Setup:**  
   - Place the printer on a stable, raised platform or an anti-vibration mat.
  
2. **Positioning & Cable Management:**  
   - Ensure there’s enough clearance around the printer for airflow and maintenance.
   - Secure all cables neatly with ties.

3. **Initial Test:**  
   - Power up the printer.
   - Run a calibration print (e.g., a Benchy) to verify that the environment is stable and that the insulation, ventilation, and power setup are functioning as intended.

---

## **6. Ongoing Maintenance & Best Practices**

- **Environmental Monitoring:**  
  - Regularly check the temperature and humidity inside the shed.
  - Adjust the temperature controller settings if needed.
  
- **Inspection:**  
  - Periodically inspect the foam insulation, sealing tape, and fan mounting for any signs of wear or moisture ingress.
  - Check the power cable pass-through to ensure it remains weatherproof.
  
- **Safety Procedures:**  
  - Disconnect power before performing any maintenance.
  - Document any adjustments for future troubleshooting.

# Summary Notes on Fan Size & Power

- **Fan Size:**  
  - **80 mm Fans** are recommended due to the compact shed dimensions and ease of mounting.  
  - **Multiple 80 mm Fans:** If additional airflow is needed, two 80 mm fans (installed strategically) can be more effective than a single larger fan.
  
- **Powering the Fans:**  
  - Fans cannot run directly on AC power; they require DC power.  
  - Use a dedicated 12V DC adapter or have the digital temperature controller supply DC power to the fans.
  - Ensure all wiring is rated for the voltage and that connections are secure and weatherproof.

By following these detailed steps and recommendations—including choosing XPS insulation, creating a sealed fan opening, using an 80 mm Noctua fan (or multiple if needed), and correctly powering your fan via a DC adapter or controller—you’ll create a safe, efficient, and controlled environment for your Anycubic Kobra 3 Max 3D printer within your garden shed.
