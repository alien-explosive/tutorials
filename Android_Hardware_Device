# 📱 **Tutorial: Using a Physical Android Device as an Emulator in Android Studio**

If you’re using **Windows on ARM64** (or if your emulator is too slow), you can **use your Android phone as an emulator** to test your apps. This guide walks you through **step-by-step** on how to set up your Android device for debugging.

## **🔧 Step 1: Enable Developer Mode on Your Android Device**
Before you can debug apps on your phone, you need to enable **Developer Options**.

### **1. Enable Developer Mode**
1. Open **Settings** on your Android device.
2. Scroll down and tap **About phone**.
3. Find **Build Number** and **tap it 7 times**.
4. You’ll see a message: **"You are now a developer!"** 🎉

### **2. Enable USB Debugging**
1. Go to **Settings** → **Developer Options**.
2. Find **USB Debugging** and turn it **ON**.
3. When prompted, tap **Allow**.

## **🔗 Step 2: Connect Your Android Device to Your PC**
Now, we need to **connect your phone** to your computer so Android Studio can recognize it.

### **Option 1: Connect via USB (Recommended)**
1. Use a **USB cable** to connect your phone to your PC.
2. On your phone, when prompted with **"Allow USB Debugging?"**, tap **Allow**.
3. (Optional) If you want to always allow this PC, check **"Always allow from this computer"**.

### **Option 2: Connect Wirelessly via Wi-Fi (Optional)**
If you don’t want to use a cable, you can **debug over Wi-Fi**:
1. Make sure your **PC and phone are on the same Wi-Fi network**.
2. Open **Command Prompt (cmd) or PowerShell** and type:
   ```sh
   adb tcpip 5555
   ```
3. Find your **phone’s IP address**:  
   - Go to **Settings** → **About phone** → **Status** → **IP Address**.
4. Connect to your phone using:
   ```sh
   adb connect <PHONE_IP>:5555
   ```
   Example:
   ```sh
   adb connect 192.168.1.10:5555
   ```

## **🖥 Step 3: Verify Connection in Android Studio**
1. Open **Android Studio**.
2. Go to **Device Manager** (**View** → **Tool Windows** → **Device Manager**).
3. Under **Physical Devices**, your phone should appear.  
   - If it’s not listed, restart Android Studio and try again.
4. If the connection is successful, you can now run your app **directly on your phone**! 🚀

## **🐞 Step 4: Run & Debug Your Flutter or Android App**
Now, let's run a test app on your device.

### **For Native Android (Java/Kotlin) Apps**
1. Open your **Android project** in Android Studio.
2. In the top-right **device selector**, choose your **Android phone**.
3. Click **Run ▶️** or **Debug 🐞**.
4. Your app will **launch on your phone!** 🎉

### **For Flutter Apps**
1. Open your **Flutter project** in Android Studio or VS Code.
2. Run:
   ```sh
   flutter devices
   ```
   - If your device is listed, you’re good to go!
3. Start the app on your phone:
   ```sh
   flutter run
   ```
   - Your app will now launch on your phone! 📱🚀

## **🔥 Troubleshooting**
### **Device Not Showing in `adb devices`?**
- Make sure **USB Debugging** is enabled on your phone.
- Try using a **different USB cable or port**.
- Run:
  ```sh
  adb kill-server
  adb start-server
  ```
- If you're on Windows, install the **USB driver** for your phone:
  - **Google USB Drivers**: [Download](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/win-usb)
  - **Samsung USB Drivers**: [Download](https://developer.samsung.com/mobile/android-usb-driver.html)
  - **For other brands**, check the manufacturer’s website.

### **App Doesn't Launch?**
- Restart **Android Studio** and try again.
- Run:
  ```sh
  flutter clean
  flutter pub get
  ```
- Check if you have **multiple devices** connected with:
  ```sh
  adb devices
  ```
